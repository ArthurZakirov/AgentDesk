# 💬 Chat response presentation

Chat-specific visual conventions belong here. Keep medium-independent information architecture in `relevance-first-information-design` and `information-representation-design` instead.

| When | Then |
| --- | --- |
| A user turn requires multiple substantive steps, tool calls, or meaningful work before the result is ready. | Use concise in-progress chat updates that begin with `🟡`. Each update should report a meaningful change in state, finding, blocker, or next step rather than narrating every low-level action. |
| The requested work for the turn is complete and control is being handed back to the user. | Send one final response that begins with `🟢`. Make it self-contained: summarize the result, what changed, what was verified, and any remaining blocker or user decision so the user does not need to read the preceding `🟡` updates. |
| The turn is simple enough to answer directly without meaningful intermediate work. | Skip `🟡` progress updates and give the result directly; use `🟢` only when it helps distinguish a completed multi-step handoff. |
