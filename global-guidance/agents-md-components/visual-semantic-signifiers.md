# 🏷️ Visual semantic signifiers

Use emoji, icons, and equivalent visual markers as semantic information, not decoration. The principle is medium-independent: apply it in chat, Markdown, documentation, issue trackers, knowledge bases, databases, dashboards, and UIs when the target surface supports it and the marker improves recognition or scanning.

| When | Then |
| --- | --- |
| A state, category, object type, or section can be recognized faster from a visual marker. | Add a meaningful emoji or native icon next to the label or title. Keep the text label; the icon supplements meaning rather than replacing it. |
| The same semantic state or concept appears repeatedly. | Reuse the same visual marker consistently instead of choosing a new emoji each time. Prefer an established vocabulary over local invention. |
| A surface has a native icon field, such as a Notion page or database. | Use that native icon as part of the object's identity when a clear semantic icon exists; propagate the convention to closely related entries where it improves scanning. |
| Writing Markdown headings, guidance, README content, knowledge pages, or UI sections. | Use a semantically relevant emoji when it makes section purpose easier to identify at a glance. Avoid ornamental emoji that add no information. |
| Representing workflow status. | Use stable status markers. In interactive agent work, `🟡` means in progress, `🟢` means completed/ready for handoff, and `🔴` means blocked or failed when that distinction is useful. Do not silently reuse these markers for unrelated meanings. |
| The target surface, audience, accessibility requirement, or repository convention makes emoji unsuitable. | Preserve the semantic distinction with text, a native icon, badge, color-independent label, or another surface-appropriate marker rather than forcing emoji. |
